The attachment is fixed, it doesn't need to rotate as in the original design. The robot rotates instead. 

The success rate of this design is about 2/3. The failure mode is always that as the robot when it pushes back and forth, it moves to the side and no longer engages.

Possible solutions:

- (easiest) Try some rubber piece to see if we can prevent it from sliding too much
- (harder) Fixing the angle every time we go back and forth - would need angle sensor

Also, may want to consider using the feedback control block to move forward to ensure repeatability
